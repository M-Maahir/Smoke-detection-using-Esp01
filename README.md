# Smoke-detection-using-Esp01

I have desgined a smoke sensor using 555 timmer IC and ESP01 as a wifi model
Thought there are better alternaties of smoke sensors
I took a different approach to build something from what I have learned from my accadmeics and personal experinces.

It might look unnessary at first to use to timmer IC as a switch but I designed and chose this IC based on my practical case where the
